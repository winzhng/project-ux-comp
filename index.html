        <h2>Labour and Materials</h2>
        <p>Modular building provides labour and material benefits as well as being environmental friendly.  Modules are built off site, using precise construction techniques, ensuring that the exact amount of materials are used without waste.  Less concrete is used on site and the modules get set up quickly, keeping labour costs down by finishing building quickly.
