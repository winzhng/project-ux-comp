        <h2>Environmental Benefits</h2>
        <p>Modules are constructed using recycled materials and bamboo components, as well as parts from other modules that are not currently being used, as they can be reused into different modules.  The modules produce a small amount of construction waste as they are made precisely to order.  There is also less onsite disturbance, making construction in sensitive areas possible, without damaging the ecosystem itâ€™s in.</p>

        <h2>Labour and Materials</h2>
            <p>Modular building provides labour and material benefits as well as being environmental friendly.  Modules are built off site, using precise construction techniques, ensuring that the exact amount of materials are used without waste.  Less concrete is used on site and the modules get set up quickly, keeping labour costs down by finishing building quickly.

        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>Modular building ensures flexibility whether it is moving it to a different site or having the freedom to design it however you want. The option to choose identical buildings or creating individual design concepts is decided by the owner or company. Vertical building is effective in a condensed city such as Toronto, but also beneficial to any city that is looking to expand their community vertically.</p>
